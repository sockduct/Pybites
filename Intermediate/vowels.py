Finish the get_word_max_vowels function below that takes a text string as its
input argument and returns a tuple of the word that has the most vowels and its
count.

For example running the function on the first paragraph of the Python tutorial:
    Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient
    high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-
    oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together
    with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and
    rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
It returns: ('object-oriented', 6).

In the tests we check 5 paragraphs more of this text. Good luck and have fun!
